# procurement

The purpose of this repository is to collect scripts useful for analyzing procurement data. 

The initial focus are scripts to parse the XML files available from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) and convert them to delimiated arrays. 

Future projects will include analysis and visualizations of spending patterns useful for contractors and the public.
